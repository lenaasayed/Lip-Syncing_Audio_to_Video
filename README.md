## Lip-Syncing_Audio_to_Video
The project presents VideoReTalking, a new system to edit the faces of a real-world talking head video according to input audio, producing a high-quality and lipsyncing output video even with a different emotion.

## The system has three sequential tasks

- face video generation with a canonical expression
- audio-driven lip-sync
- face enhancement for improving photo-realism.
